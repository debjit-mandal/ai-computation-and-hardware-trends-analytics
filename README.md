## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the trends in AI computation, training efforts, investments by corporations, and the market share of different countries in the logic chip production industry. By examining these datasets, we can gain insights into the development and investment patterns within the AI and hardware sectors.

## Datasets

The analysis is based on the following datasets:

1. **AI Performance vs Training Computation**: Contains information on various AI models, their average MMLU scores, and the amount of training computation used.
2. **Artificial Intelligence Training Computation**: Detailed records of training computations for various AI models over time and across different domains.
3. **Corporate Investment in Artificial Intelligence by Type**: Captures corporate investment in AI over several years, categorized by type of investment.
4. **Market Share in Logic Chip Production by Manufacturing Stage**: Provides insights into the market share of different countries in various stages of logic chip production.

## Analysis Overview

### AI Performance vs Training Computation

This section analyzes the relationship between the performance of AI models (measured by MMLU scores) and the amount of training computation used. Key analyses include basic statistics, correlation, and scatter plots.

### Artificial Intelligence Training Computation

In this section, we explore the detailed records of training computations across different domains over time. This includes handling missing values, grouping data by domain, and visualizing the total training computation by domain.

### Corporate Investment in Artificial Intelligence by Type

Here, we analyze the trends in corporate investments in AI, categorized by different types of investments. The analysis includes visualizing investment trends over the years using line plots.

### Market Share in Logic Chip Production by Manufacturing Stage

This section provides an analysis of the market share of different countries in various stages of logic chip production for the year 2021. The analysis includes bar plots for each stage of production.

## Installation
